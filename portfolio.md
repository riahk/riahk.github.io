EmojiBank

EmojiBank is a Chrome Extension that allows users to save, tag and use unicode emoticons that use uncommon characters. Simply type in an emoji and add tags to save it. To use an emoji just click, use control/command + c to copy and voila! Easy access to emoji.

EmojiBank was built using the very fun React.js framework. Get it on the Chrome Extension store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emoji-bank/ongfceokaejanhleffnndeelojpkefeg?hl=en)!
