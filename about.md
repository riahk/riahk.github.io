My name is Moriah, I'm a Bay Area native and Full-Stack Software Engineer. My main language is Javascript but I've also got experience coding in Python, Java, C and Ruby. I'm also a graduate of the Hack Reactor program, which was quite possibly one of the best experiences of my life. If I'm not coding then I'm probably either skiing, drawing or exploring a new place, music or topic.
