My name is Moriah, I'm a Bay Area native and Full-Stack Software Engineer. My main language is Javascript but I've also got experience coding in Python, Java, C and Ruby. I'm also a graduate of the Hack Reactor program, which was quite possibly one of the best experiences of my life. I build web and mobile applications for fun and profit. 

If I'm not coding then I'm probably either skiing, drawing or practicing yoga. Other things I enjoy, in no particular order: tea, cats, the ocean, pixel art and retro video games.

Check out my code over at my [github](http://github.com/riahk).
