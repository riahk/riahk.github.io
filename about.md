The short story: <br> 
My name is Moriah, I'm a 23 year old Bay Area native and graduated college this past June. 
I'm opening a new chapter of my life in a couple months, when I will be starting as a student at
Hack Reactor in San Francisco. This blog is to record my adventures, from now onward.

<br>
The long story: <br>
As a freshman in college I had a very solid idea of where my future would take me: I was
majoring in biochemistry with the hopes of getting my PhD and doing something outstanding like
cure cancer. At the beginning of my sophomore year I was working (voluntarily) in a research lab
doing what I expected I'd be doing for the rest of my life.

Life doesn't always go as planned. In fact, I'd argue it goes "right" about 10% of the time, and
let's be real, most of that 10% is sleeping. (Sleeping is great). Halfway through my junior
year, I found myself burnt out and frustrated with what I was doing. The lack of engagement was
showing in my personal and academic life, and one February morning I put my foot down and made a
big decision. I wasn't going to graduate school.

It wasn't that I hated chemistry; the subject was still fascinating to me and I am at my heart a
scientist. But the work was tedious and I suddenly felt like a fish out of water without a plan
for myself. Remembering my love for foreign languages, I added a second major in linguistics,
a curriculum that would keep me in school for an extra year to give more thought into who I was
as a person, and what I wanted.

And in my collegiate victory lap (as a good friend of mine once called it), while sitting through
lectures on phonology and syntax I also began learning a very special foreign language:
computers. With room in my class schedule I took an introduction course to programming in C out
of curiosity. 

Suddenly, I knew what I wanted to do.

Coding was addictive. The challenge of solving a problem along with the joy of creating
something of my own. The feeling of triumph after hours working through and 
debugging a program as the hours flew by. If you code (and if you're here, chances are high that
you do) you probably know the mixture of frustration and joy that comes with the process.

Of course, at that point it was too late to change majors or add a minor. I took as much 
coursework as I could before graduating, after which I dove headfirst into self-study: I learned
the basics of Python, Ruby and HTML/CSS over the course of several months. But without a degree
I was lost as to how I could move forward.

Enter Hack Reactor. For those who don't know, HR is a "programming bootcamp" that takes students
with minimal coding experience and teaches them the skills they need to be successful in the 
computer science field. I applied and, at the time of this writing, am less than two months from
my start date. My current activities include honing my coding skills, getting stoked and starting
this blog.

Considering the massive leap I'm taking, it's only appropriate that I record the experience.
Looking forward to where life will steer me!
